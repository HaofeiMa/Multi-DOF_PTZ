# Multi-DOF_PTZ
Medical multi degree of freedom pan tilt system based on binocular vision

# 1. Introduction
In traditional medical processes, there are often many limitations to the observation of surgery or rehabilitation processes. For example, when performing minor surgical operations, due to visual angle limitations, doctors need to constantly move their positions and adjust their angles to view the surgical area. During rehabilitation treatment, the camera range is also difficult to cover the patient's moving area.
The project aims to achieve real-time tracking of doctors' surgical areas or patients through driving the cloud platform, achieving auxiliary observation, camera shooting, and 3D reconstruction of key parts in the medical surgical environment, as well as real-time observation of patients during the rehabilitation and recovery process.
